**Navigation bar**
- Featured on all three pages, the navigation bar is fully responsive and includes links to home, areas of interest to vist and a form to sign up for a newsletter.

**The Landing Page**
- I tried to keep the landing page as clean and as easy to read as possible, with such a wide target audience i think this is best suited to appease to most. It includes a large photopragh which I believe captures wicklows stunning beauty and should cature their eye.

**Upcoming events section**
- This section is styled simply again, with two sections to the left and right both providing information on a seperate upcoming event and an external hyper link to more information for anyone interested after reading.
- Seperated by an image from pexel, more out there than any other image on the page but it represents a party (event) in a fun way nd should capture attention.

**Where to visit**
- I have selected three lesser visited areas than those mentioned in my 'Why visit Wicklow section' with the aim to bring more tourists to these areas whilst they are in the county.
- I styled the backround of each section on this page with a lrage background image as to grab the attention of those looking, with the title on each image leading to a webpage withg more information on each attraction.
- This section is valuable to the visiter as they are easily able to identify each of the three attractions and easily get more information, whilst still staying on site, so they can fo back and forward between the three attractions.
